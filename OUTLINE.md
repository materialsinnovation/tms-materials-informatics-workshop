# Course Outline

## Materials

The IPython notebook will be used for all the examples (unless Matlab
is required). Either way, we will try to have everything up on the web
ready to go. If people want to set up the environment on their own
laptops they can.

Many of our examples will come from the basic set of MKS examples.

## Outline

### Introduction to Materials Informatics (1:00 to 1:30, Surya)

 * Code of conduct (be friendly, very important to create good atmosphere)

 * Introduce David, Yuksel, and Ahmet

### Introduction to Python and PyMKS (1:30 to 2:30 hour, David)

 * Demo the web interface (Wakari or whatever we use)

  * Make sure everyone can log in

 * Python

  * Why Python

  * Opensource -- explain the license

  * Python data structures

  * IPython notebook
